Project HOPE is a student-initiated outreach program founded by the Vietnamese Student Union (VSU) in 1999  at UCLA. In its goal to achieve educational equity for all, HOPE provides tutoring, peer advising, workshops, and field trips for high school students in the Greater Los Angeles and Orange County areas.

Since volunteering in the winter of 2019, I have become deeply invested in the success of both HOPE and its students. Over the following academic year, I undertook the task of designing a personal website for the project.
